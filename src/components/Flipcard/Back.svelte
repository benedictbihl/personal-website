    <p>
      Originally from a small town near Stuttgart, I went on to get my
      bachelor's degree in human-computer-interaction from
      Julius-Maximilians-University in WÃ¼rzburg. During this time, I not only
      learned heaps about Usability Engineering, UX Design & Computer Science,
      but also got my first job as a Web Developer. Pretty soon I knew, that
      combining my expertise from these areas was what I wanted to pursue
      further after finishing uni.

      In my spare time you'll most likely find me in the bouldering gym on
      weekdays & somewhere in the mountains on the weekend. Some days I just
      want to spend with my PlayStation, though. Apart from that, I thoroughly
      enjoy cooking with my collection of cast iron pans & finding the right
      beer to go with my food.
